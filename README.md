## DL ML Summit Summer 2020

Welcome to the home for information on the Decision Lens Machine Learning Summit happening Summer of 2020.

### Prework
There is some work participants should complete prior to attendance:
1. Read [Data Science (MIT Press Essential Knowledge Series)](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Press-Essential-Knowledge/dp/0262535432/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2BN1NQ4MBBY6N&dchild=1&keywords=data+science+mit+press+essential+knowledge+series&qid=1592835183&sprefix=data+science+mit%2Caps%2C183&sr=8-20).  This will give us a common language to discuss data science related tasks and ideas.
2. Install a git client, either:
    1. [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/): this is the default application we use at Decision Lens for git.
    2. Or [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/): if you do not have Sourcetree already installed on your computer, I recommend installing Github Desktop instead.  It is simpler and easier for first time users.
3. Install [Anaconda with Python 3.7](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).  This will give you access to Python and the wonderous [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) system for Python programming.
4. Clone this repository, the instructions are:
   1. For Github Desktop, you:
      1. Goto https://github.com/dlens/ML2020
      1. Click on the green clone/download button.
   2. For Sourcetree:
      1. Select File/Clone from the menu
      2. Input the URL https://github.com/dlens/ML2020
